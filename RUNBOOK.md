# Phase-2 Daily Production Runbook

**Active ruleset:** `fb0af0ac` — v1.8.1 alpha_modifier_off
**Engine:** v1.3.0
**Last updated:** 2026-03-05

---

## 1. Daily command (single entrypoint)

```bash
python3 tools/run_daily_production.py --as-of-date YYYY-MM-DD
```

No manual pre-warm steps. The runner is self-sufficient:

| Step | What it does |
|---|---|
| 1 | Incremental `price_history.csv` refresh via Yahoo Finance |
| 1.5 | Warm `sec_8k`, `ctgov`, `sec_13f` caches (idempotent — skips if already fresh) |
| 2 | Run screen → staging dir |
| 2.5 | Create PIT price anchor from staging `rankings.csv` (before gates) |
| 3 | Data integrity audit |
| 4 | Evaluate all gates |
| 5 | Build run manifest + atomic promotion to `data/snapshots/YYYY-MM-DD/` |
| 6 | (opt-in) PIT price backfill via `--price-pit-backfill` |

If `market_data.json` is stale the runner auto-calls `collect_market_data.py` before aborting.

**Escape hatches:**

```bash
# Skip all PIT warming (CI handles externally):
python3 tools/run_daily_production.py --as-of-date DATE --skip-pit-warm

# Use prior ctgov cache if today's isn't available yet (WARN instead of FAIL):
python3 tools/run_daily_production.py --as-of-date DATE --allow-date-fallback

# Override warm sources (empty string = skip warm entirely):
python3 tools/run_daily_production.py --as-of-date DATE --warm-sources "ctgov,sec_13f"
```

---

## 2. Exit codes

| Code | Meaning |
|---|---|
| 0 | All gates PASS — snapshot promoted |
| 1 | Hard gate FAIL — snapshot stays in staging, not promoted |
| 2 | Soft gate WARN — snapshot promoted but flagged |

---

## 3. Notifications

The CI pipeline sends push notifications when a hard FAIL or rollback-recommended condition is detected.

### Email (always on, no config required)

GitHub Actions automatically emails the repository owner when a workflow job fails (exit code 1).
Configure in: **GitHub repo → Settings → Notifications → Email notifications for workflow failures**.

### Slack webhook (optional)

Add a `SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL` repository secret to receive Slack alerts on FAIL or rollback:

1. Create a Slack incoming webhook at https://api.slack.com/messaging/webhooks
2. Add the webhook URL as a repository secret:
   - GitHub repo → Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions → New repository secret
   - Name: `SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL`
   - Value: `https://hooks.slack.com/services/...`

When configured, the CI `notify_on_degradation` step calls `tools/send_alert.py`, which:
- Posts a formatted attachment with gate summary, action items, and 4w net return
- Is **non-blocking**: a Slack delivery failure never fails the CI job
- Posts for `exit_code == 1` (hard FAIL) **or** `rollback_recommended == true`

### WARN annotations

WARN-level issues are emitted as `::warning::` annotations in GitHub Actions, visible in
the Actions UI under "Annotations" on the commit or PR.

### Manual alert test

```bash
python3 tools/send_alert.py --level WARN --date 2026-03-05 --dry-run
python3 tools/send_alert.py --level FAIL --date 2026-03-05 --webhook "$SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL"
```

## 4. Gate reference and expected daily status

### Hard gates (FAIL = snapshot not promoted)

| Gate | Normal | FAIL condition |
|---|---|---|
| `xbi_staleness` | PASS | XBI price gap > 3 trading days |
| `ctgov_cache` | PASS | ctgov cache absent after warm attempt |
| `inputs_present` | PASS | `market_data.json` or `universe.json` missing |
| `market_data_schema` | PASS | Required fields absent/malformed |
| `market_data_staleness` | PASS | `market_data.json` age > 3d (auto-refresh fires first) |
| `market_data_coverage` | PASS | < 90% of universe tickers have market data |
| `screen` | PASS | `run_screen.py` exits non-zero |
| `audit` | PASS | `data_integrity_audit.py` exits non-zero |
| `sort_contrib_sanity` | PASS | Any sort contrib > 50 or non-finite |
| `exposure_missingness` | PASS | > 25% eligible tickers missing an exposure |
| `risk_concentration` | PASS | > 50% top-K weight has catalyst ≤ 7d |

### Soft gates (WARN = promoted with flag)

These should be **PASS on a healthy day** after 2026-03-05:

| Gate | Normal | WARN condition |
|---|---|---|
| `drift_monitoring` | PASS | > 30% top-20 turnover vs prior (day-1 after promotion is normal) |
| `ruleset_health` | PASS | Rank drift vs baseline exceeds 3× warn factor |
| `sec_13f_cache` | PASS | 13F warm failed or < 80% coverage |
| `price_pit_cache` | PASS | Price anchor missing for as-of date |
| `pit_bundle_health` | PASS | ctgov or 13F prerequisite missing |
| `institutional_summary` | PASS | Sidecar missing or low coverage |
| `institutional_delta` | PASS | Delta sidecar not written |
| `cache_health` | PASS | sec_8k or ctgov cache marked bad |
| `forward_eval` | PASS (cold-start until horizons fill) | Rolling IC below floor |
| `pnl_attribution` | **WARN expected** (see §4) | Price data unavailable for attribution period |
| `risk_concentration` | **WARN expected** (see §4) | > 50% top-K high-beta or drawdown positions |

---

## 5. Known persistent WARNs (not actionable)

### `pnl_attribution` — price lag

```
PnL coverage 0.0% below 80.0%
```

PnL attribution computes returns between T-1 and T positions, requiring closing prices for both dates. During the burn-in period we're running for dates ahead of available Yahoo Finance data, so `n_priced=0`. This resolves automatically once the runner operates in a T+1 workflow (e.g. running Monday evening for Monday's close).

**This is not a model failure.** The turnover and position-action breakdown still populate correctly.

### `risk_concentration` — portfolio composition signal

```
high_risk=55% > 50% WARN
```

55% of top-20 positions have beta ≥ 1.5 or drawdown ≤ -30%. This reflects structural biotech characteristics (high beta is sector-wide). The 50% warn threshold is intentionally conservative to surface real crowding events. **Review if this rises above 70%** or if `stacked_wt` (catalyst ≤ 7d AND high-risk) becomes non-zero.

## 6. Burn-in results (new self-sufficient runner)

Gate key: ✓ PASS · ! WARN · ✗ FAIL · — not run

| Gate | 03-03 pre-fix | 03-04 pre-fix | **03-05 new runner** |
|---|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| `cache_health` | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| `drift_monitoring` | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| `ruleset_health` | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| `sec_13f_cache` | ! | ! | **✓** |
| `price_pit_cache` | ! | ! | **✓** |
| `pit_bundle_health` | ! | ! | **✓** |
| `institutional_summary` | ! | ! | **✓** |
| `institutional_delta` | ! | ! | **✓** |
| `pnl_attribution` | ! | ! | ! (price lag — expected) |
| `forward_eval` | — | — | ✓ cold-start |

03-06 aborted: XBI staleness FAIL — no new Yahoo data available yet for that week.

---

## 7. Ruleset health and rollback

### Monitor

```bash
tail -10 artifacts/ruleset_health_history.jsonl | python3 -c "
import json, sys
for line in sys.stdin:
    d = json.loads(line)
    print(d.get('as_of_date'), d.get('status'), d.get('detail','')[:70])
"
```

**Rollback trigger:** 3 consecutive `ruleset_health` WARN days.

### Rollback to last known good

```bash
python3 tools/promote_ruleset.py --rollback --reason "3 consecutive ruleset_health WARNs"
```

Then update `PHASE2_PINNED_RULESET_ID` in both `run_screen.py` and `scripts/run_phase2_snapshot_delta.py` to match the new active ID.

### Check active ruleset

```bash
python3 -c "
import json
m = json.load(open('production_data/decision_rulesets/manifest.json'))
r = next(r for r in m['rulesets'] if r['status']=='active')
print(r['id'], r['file'], r['description'])
"
```

## 9. Common failures and fixes

### XBI staleness FAIL
```
XBI last=2026-03-02, as_of=2026-03-06, gap=4 trading days
```
Yahoo Finance data usually appears 15–30 min after 4 pm ET. Re-run after market close, or run for the prior trading day.

### ctgov cache FAIL (after warm)
```
CTGov cache gate: FAIL — PIT cache missing after warm
```
CTGov API is down or network error. Retry manually:
```bash
python3 warm_caches.py --as-of-date DATE --sources ctgov
```
Or use `--allow-date-fallback` to fall back to prior day's cache (WARN instead of FAIL).

### Screen FAIL
```
Screen FAILED (exit 1)
```
Run `run_screen.py` manually with the same args to see the full traceback. Most common causes: missing data dependency, PIT violation, or DE schema mismatch.

### Market data stale + auto-refresh failure
```
Market data stale — auto-refreshing ...
Market data refresh FAILED (exit 1)
```
Run manually:
```bash
python3 collect_market_data.py --universe production_data/universe.json
```
Then re-run the daily runner.

## Evaluation pitfalls

### A/B comparisons must rerank both legs

When comparing two rulesets using `eval_forward_returns.py`, **both candidate and
baseline must be reranked through their respective rulesets** via
`scripts/research/rerank_snapshots.py`. Never compare reranked candidate snapshots
against raw `data/snapshots/` — those contain a mix of historical rulesets and will
produce misleading IC deltas (discovered 2026-03-03, v1.8.2 promotion).

Correct workflow:
```bash
# Rerank both legs
python3 scripts/research/rerank_snapshots.py --ruleset <candidate.json> --out-root /tmp/reranked_candidate
python3 scripts/research/rerank_snapshots.py --ruleset <baseline.json>  --out-root /tmp/reranked_baseline

# Eval both against same price data
python3 scripts/eval_forward_returns.py --snapshot-root /tmp/reranked_candidate --out-dir /tmp/eval_candidate ...
python3 scripts/eval_forward_returns.py --snapshot-root /tmp/reranked_baseline  --out-dir /tmp/eval_baseline  ...
```

`eval_ruleset.py --rerank-only` handles this internally (reranks both legs on the fly)
and is safe for gate verdicts, but does not compute forward returns.

## 10. Weekly health packet

### Generating

```bash
python3 tools/weekly_health_packet.py                          # latest snapshot
python3 tools/weekly_health_packet.py --as-of-date 2026-03-07  # specific date
```

Output: `output/health_packets/health_YYYY-MM-DD.md` + `.json`

In CI (`phase2-daily-production.yml`), the packet is generated automatically after every
successful run and uploaded as a `health-packet-YYYY-MM-DD` artifact (180-day retention).
The markdown is also appended to the GitHub Actions step summary.

### Action threshold policy (what requires a response)

| Signal | Condition | Action |
|--------|-----------|--------|
| Gate FAIL | Any gate in FAIL | Investigate immediately |
| Drift WARN streak | ≥ 2 consecutive WARN days | Review drift report; consider rollback |
| Ruleset rollback flag | `recommend_rollback: true` in `ruleset_health.json` | Run rollback check (`scripts/promote_ruleset.py --rollback`) |
| Turnover spike | This-week > 2.5× trailing 4-week avg **and** > 5% | Check for composition change or data anomaly |
| Cache health | Explicit `warn` or `fail` (not `unknown`) | Re-warm cache; check `cache_health.json` |

**Not actionable**: `unknown` cache health (old snapshots), single-day drift WARN,
fresh-start turnover (shown as `—`).

### Relaxed mode

Pass `--relaxed` to generate a packet for a non-production run (e.g., a backtest
snapshot or a manual re-run). The output gets a prominent `⚠ RELAXED MODE` banner
and is not suitable for governance review. Relaxed packets are never uploaded by CI.

## 11. WSL2 sleep-cliff mitigation

The daily cron runs 16:30–19:30 ET on weekdays. If the Windows host suspends during
that window, crons are silently missed, OAuth tokens drift, and the fleet goes blind.

### Stopgap: disable AC sleep (run once as Administrator in Windows)

```
powercfg /change standby-timeout-ac 0
```

Verify:
```
powercfg /query SCHEME_CURRENT SUB_SLEEP STANDBYIDLE
```
Expected: `Power Setting Index: 0x00000000`

To restore sleep (e.g. on a laptop you carry home):
```
powercfg /change standby-timeout-ac 30
```

### Confirming WSL2 was awake for a given run

Check cron.log for the 16:30 ET entry:
```
grep "16:3" logs/cron.log | tail -5
```
If the line is absent for a weekday, the host was asleep. The `@reboot` catch-up
cron re-runs on next WSL2 startup (up to 23:59 ET same day).

### Known failure signature

A missed cron produces a 24–48h gap in `data/snapshots/`. Downstream symptoms:
- `institutional_summary_delta.json` absent → `inst_delta_z = 0.0` for entire universe
- OAuth tokens expire after 24h silence → agent fleet loses auth on restart
- Sentinel may emit false `ROLLBACK_RECOMMENDED` due to missing comparison baseline

### Durable fix (VPS migration — planned, not yet executed)

Move cron + production pipeline to a $15/mo Linux VPS (DigitalOcean / Hetzner).
WSL2 remains the dev environment. No timeline set.

## 12. May 15 13F refresh — operator checklist

Q1 2026 13F filings begin landing ~May 13–15, 2026 (45-day SEC deadline from
March 31 quarter-end).

### Pre-refresh (run by May 13)

```bash
source .env && python3 tools/prep_13f_refresh.py
```

Expected: all 5 checks PASS; artifact at `artifacts/13f_pre_refresh_baseline_YYYY-MM-DD.json`.
Note the `--pre-date` value (most recent snapshot, e.g. `2026-05-14`).

### During refresh window (May 15–22)

Monitor `data/snapshots/<date>/institutional_summary_delta.json` for `prior_date`
advancing from `2025-12-31` → `2026-03-31`. This is the primary refresh signal.

```bash
python3 -c "
import json, pathlib
d = json.loads(pathlib.Path('data/snapshots/<POST_DATE>/institutional_summary_delta.json').read_text())
print('prior_date:', d['prior_date'], '  tickers:', d['tickers_in_current'])
"
```

### Post-refresh quarantine check (run once prior_date advances)

```bash
source .env && python3 -m tools.check_13f_cohort_quarantine \
    --pre-date 2026-05-14 \
    --post-date <POST_DATE> \
    --output artifacts/13f_diff_<POST_DATE>.md
```

Verdicts and required actions:

| Verdict | Meaning | Action |
|---|---|---|
| `NO_QUARANTINE` | Clean refresh, Jaccard ≥ 0.85 | Normal operation |
| `STANDARD_COHORT_WINDOW` | Jaccard 0.70–0.85, expected | Attribution-only for ~10 days |
| `QUARANTINE` | Jaccard < 0.70 | Attribution-only until ~10 trading days post-refresh |
| `PRODUCER_AUDIT_REQUIRED` | Coverage dropped ≥ 10pp | Audit `institutional_summary.json` producer |

Telegram alert fires automatically on QUARANTINE or PRODUCER_AUDIT_REQUIRED.

### Collapse guard

If `coinvest_score_z` SD near zero after refresh:

```bash
python3 -c "
import csv, statistics, pathlib
rows = list(csv.DictReader(open('data/snapshots/<DATE>/rankings.csv')))
vals = [float(r['coinvest_score_z']) for r in rows if r.get('coinvest_score_z') not in ('', None, 'nan')]
print(f'n={len(vals)} sd={statistics.stdev(vals):.4f}')
"
```

SD < 0.10 indicates the selector signal collapsed — run_screen.py DEFAULT_ROW fallback.
Check `institutional_summary_delta.json` producer freshness (G2 in quarantine script).
