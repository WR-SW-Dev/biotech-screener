# Domain: Agent Operations (WARM)

<!-- Cross-cutting Hermes / Cursor / Cloud patterns. ≤200 lines. -->

## Host authority

| Host | Authoritative for |
| --- | --- |
| Operator WSL | `crontab`, `output/hedge_report/`, `~/.hermes/config.yaml`, B1b producer |
| Cursor Cloud | Repo plumbing, CodeGraph index, skills sync, ledger **build** (read-only) |

Cloud knowledge-layer builds emit `UNKNOWN_CLOUD_ENV` for C1/C3 — not a pass/fail. First-fire `FAIL_ARTIFACT_MISSING_PAST_DEADLINE` is expected without hedge artifacts in checkout.

## Hermes surfaces (do not conflate)

| Surface | Model? | Role |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Hermes MCP | No | Fleet registry, SOUL, ledgers when built |
| Lane A `hermes-*` jobs | No | Deterministic governance |
| Gateway `~/.hermes/config.yaml` | Yes | OpenRouter / DeepSeek intent on WSL |
| `run_agent_direct.py` | Yes (bypass) | Defaults Together Llama — not gateway |

## CodeGraph (bounded)

- MCP in Cursor; CLI on shell; Hermes cron uses `common/codegraph_guard.py`
- Rule: **CodeGraph first, grep/read second, edit third**
- Not proof for cron, subprocess, file-path literals, or dynamic dispatch
- Pin: `@colbymchenry/codegraph@0.9.9` in `.cursor/environment.json`

## Agent registry profiles

- Current repo fleet: 31 directories = 29 active + 2 deprecated retained workspaces (`bioshort_watch`, `shadow_watch`).
- Registry is bidirectional: every entry must have a matching `agents/<name>/` directory; absent retired overlaps stay documented in Hermes docs, not in `AGENT_REGISTRY.json`.

## CI signals

- Actions budget exhaustion pre-start → infrastructure, not PR regression
- Track B governance tests in draft PR — expected skips, not gates to “fix” toward scoring

## Skill ↔ knowledge recursion

1. Lesson → `LEARNINGS.md` with `Pattern-Key`
2. Promote → `memory.md` or this file
3. Executable → `skills/*` + `harvest_log.md`
4. Audit → `audit_learnings.py` + `audit_hermes_skills.py`
