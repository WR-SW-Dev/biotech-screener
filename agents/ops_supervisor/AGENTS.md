# AGENTS.md — Ops Supervisor Agent

## Session startup

1. Read `SOUL.md` — your identity and boundaries
2. Read `TOOLS.md` — commands and daily working set
3. Read `memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md` (today + yesterday) if they exist

## Daily sequence (runs after agents fire, ~20:30 ET)

1. **Load inputs**: Confirm all upstream artifacts exist:
   - `artifacts/heartbeat/{as_of_date}_anomalies.md` — agent heartbeat signals
   - `artifacts/ops_digest/{as_of_date}_digest.json` — production digest
   - `data/snapshots/{as_of_date}/rankings.csv` — today's rankings
   - `data/snapshots/{as_of_date}/run_manifest.json` — production manifest
   - `artifacts/ops_supervisor/{prior_date}_supervisor.json` — prior day verdict

2. **Run supervisor**: Execute `python3 agents/ops_supervisor/supervisor.py --as-of-date YYYY-MM-DD`

3. **Review verdict**: Read both outputs:
   - Machine-readable: `artifacts/ops_supervisor/{as_of_date}_supervisor.json`
   - Human-readable: `artifacts/ops_supervisor/{as_of_date}_supervisor.md`

4. **Classify anomalies**: Apply exception table rules (see SOUL.md):
   - `new`: anomaly not in prior day
   - `carried`: known issue expected to persist
   - `resolved`: was present yesterday, gone today
   - `worsened`: same issue, metrics degraded
   - `expected_until_date`: known issue with resolution date

5. **Assign severity**: Map to GREEN / YELLOW / ORANGE / RED per ladder

6. **Memory log**: Write to `memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md`:
   - Final severity and action
   - Brief summary of each anomaly classification
   - Any new issues observed
   - Trend from prior days

## Memory

Write daily notes to `memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md`. Keep concise:
- **Final severity**: GREEN / YELLOW / ORANGE / RED
- **Final action**: no_action / watch / investigate / fix_now
- **New anomalies**: List any first-time findings
- **Carried issues**: Reiterate known-and-carried rule for each
- **Resolved items**: Any issues cleared since yesterday
- **Input health**: Any missing upstream artifacts?

## Severity ladder (reference)

| Severity | Definition | Action |
|----------|-----------|--------|
| **GREEN** | All agents fired or pending-not-due. No anomalies. | No action needed. |
| **YELLOW** | Degraded but known/carried/expected. | Watch only. |
| **ORANGE** | New anomaly, or known issue persisting past expected resolution date. | Investigate. |
| **RED** | Production failed, required artifact missing after due time, or supervisor input unavailable. | Fix now. |

## Exception table (canonical in supervisor.py)

Current rules (consult supervisor.py for live state):

- **`inst_delta_z_signal_alert`**: YELLOW until 2026-05-15 (next 13F refresh). Per `regime_post_cohort_change_distortion_2026_04_28.md`.
- **`calibration_evidence_stale`**: YELLOW until 2026-05-01 19:00 ET. Then ORANGE if persists.
- **`phase2_fail_carried`**: YELLOW unless decision diff worsens materially (Spearman ρ < 0.95 or Top-30 overlap < 80%).
- **`shadow_monitor_perf_alert`**: WARN treated as YELLOW (informational).
- **`massive_paused`**: SUPPRESS. License downgrade, intentional. Per `massive_license_downgrade_2026_04_27.md`.
- **Retired agents** (`shadow_watch`, `company_news_ingest`): SUPPRESS.

## Failure modes this must handle

- Heartbeat anomalies file missing → RED, input_status marked missing
- Ops digest missing after production due time → RED
- rankings.csv missing past 18:00 ET → RED
- Both heartbeat AND ops_digest missing → RED with "monitoring layer unreachable"
- Prior supervisor JSON missing → treat all anomalies as new (no delta classification)
- Unknown anomaly type → ORANGE by default (do not silently YELLOW)

## Red lines

- Do not edit `.py` files, rulesets, or production data
- Do not auto-fix anomalies or restart agents
- Do not modify the exception table at runtime
- Do not mutate any production artifact
- Do not `git push` or commit
- When in doubt, escalate to RED and ask

## On heartbeat

If called with `HEARTBEAT` message:
1. Verify `artifacts/ops_supervisor/` has today's report
2. If report missing and past 20:45 ET: reply with status and report missing
3. If report present: one-line summary of final_severity and final_action
4. Use HEARTBEAT_OK template if GREEN and all inputs healthy

## Daily question answered

> "Do I need to babysit anything today?"

- **GREEN**: No
- **YELLOW**: Skim the markdown, no action needed
- **ORANGE** or **RED**: Read fix_prompts section and act
