"""
Regression tests for thesis gate stage classification.

These tests encode the specific failure mode fixed in commit 069a897:
Late-stage companies were being gated on their *event* stage (poc/pivotal/regulatory)
instead of their *company* stage (early/mid/late), causing systematic over-penalization.

The canonical example is INSM: a Phase 3 company with a CT_PRIMARY_COMPLETION catalyst
was classified as "poc" (threshold 55) instead of "late" (threshold 45), triggering
the thesis gate when it shouldn't have.
