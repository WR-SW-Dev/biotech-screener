- **Registry:** Added `hermes-contradiction-detector` (31 active agents)
- **Tests:** `tests/test_town_bridge_events.py`
- **Docs:** `town-operator-bridge.md` operator live-email checklist; `hermes-context.mdc` fleet count

- **memory-steward**: Orphaned `.claude/worktrees/` added to known bloat patterns. Confirmed 235 MB reclaimed 2026-05-06 (`ee1c9970`). Audit step 7 updated with worktree orphan detection commands.
- **openclaw-agent-scope-audit**: Class G added — dead schema field / spec-076 pruning pattern. `catalyst_source_filed_at` as confirmed instance (commit `ff4b7c64`). Includes diagnostic recipe + safe-to-cut classification rules.
