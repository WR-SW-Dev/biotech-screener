# Self-Improving Skill

Structured learning capture with promotion, demotion, and **repo skill recursion** for persistent improvement.

## When to Use

- User corrects you or points out mistakes
- You complete significant work and want to evaluate the outcome
- You notice a repeatable pattern in your own output
- A session discovered operator workflow, tooling, or convention knowledge that should survive the next agent

## Recursive improvement loop (biotech-screener)

Knowledge compounds in **four stores**, then feeds back into **skills**:

```
Observe → Log → Distill → Promote → Skill-patch → Sync → Verify → (next session)
```

| Step | Action | Store |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Observe** | Correction, CI surprise, ops gate miss, codegraph gap | Session context |
| **Log** | Raw event | `.learnings/corrections.md` or `.learnings/LEARNINGS.md` `[LRN-...]` |
| **Distill** | 3x same Pattern-Key in 7 days | `.learnings/memory.md` (HOT) or `.learnings/projects/biotech_screener.md` (WARM) |
| **Promote** | Cross-session, operator-relevant workflow | `skills/<dir>/SKILL.md` |
| **Sync** | Hermes mirror + registry | `python3 tools/sync_hermes_skills.py` |
| **Verify** | No drift | `python3 tools/audit_hermes_skills.py` |
| **Record** | Human-readable history | `docs/hermes_skills/harvest_log.md` + git commit |

**Rule:** learnings improve **how agents work**; they do not change production scoring without governance Spec.

Long templates: `skills/self-improving/REFERENCE.md`.

### What may become a skill patch

| Eligible | Ineligible without Spec |
| --- | --- |
| CodeGraph MCP vs CLI naming | Ranker/selector/sizing weights |
| WSL vs Cloud authority | `decision_engine`, `final_score` behavior |
| CI budget vs code failure | Snapshot schema / promotion semantics |
| Sync/harvest workflow | Cron lines or gateway `config.yaml` |
| Test contract / flake patterns | Production KG wiring |

Default skill targets: `screener_ops`, `codegraph`, `openclaw-agent-optimize`, `self-improving` (meta). Tier 3: add preflight notes to `selector_ranker` only — never relax BLOCKED gates.

### Session-end trigger (significant work)

1. One-line reflection: met expectations? repeatable?
2. If correction → append `corrections.md`
3. If Pattern-Key recurrence ≥ 3 → new `LEARNINGS.md` entry or bump Recurrence-Count
4. If promoted to HOT/WARM → update `memory.md` or `projects/biotech_screener.md` (stay within line limits)
5. If skill-worthy → patch `skills/`, sync, audit, `harvest_log.md`, commit

## Memory Architecture

### Town Environment (Primary)

Use Town's native memory system with tiered importance:

| Tier | Storage | Purpose |
|------|---------|---------|
| HOT (critical) | `add_memory()` global | Always-active patterns affecting all routines |
| WARM (routine-specific) | `add_memory(routine_slug=...)` | Per-routine learned behaviors |
| COLD (archived) | Delete from active; note in user profile if historically significant | Decayed patterns no longer needed |

### Hermes / Cursor Environment (this repo)

File-based storage in `.learnings/`:

| Tier | File | Limit | Purpose |
|------|------|-------|---------|
| HOT | `memory.md` | <=100 lines | Always loaded, most critical patterns |
| WARM | `projects/biotech_screener.md` | <=200 lines | Per-project learnings |
| WARM | `domains/{name}.md` | <=200 lines | Domain-specific patterns |
| COLD | `archive/` | Unlimited | Decayed patterns |
| LOG | `corrections.md` | Last 50 | Raw correction log |
| INDEX | `LEARNINGS.md` | Growing | Structured LRN entries with Pattern-Key + Recurrence-Count |

Repo skills (loaded by Cursor/Hermes) are the **executable** layer above `.learnings/`.

## Learning Signals

### Log immediately
- **Corrections**: "No, that's not right...", "Actually, it should be...", "You're wrong about...", "I prefer X, not Y", "Stop doing X"
- **Preferences**: "I like when you...", "Always do X for me", "Never do Y"

### Track and promote after 3x
- **Patterns**: Recurring mistakes, recurring successes, recurring workarounds (use Pattern-Key in LEARNINGS.md)

### Ignore
- One-time instructions
- Context-specific guidance
- Hypotheticals

---

## Self-Reflection Framework

After completing significant work:
1. Did it meet expectations?
2. What could be better?
3. Is this a pattern (Pattern-Key)?

Log format:
```
CONTEXT: [task type]
REFLECTION: [what I noticed]
LESSON: [what to do differently]
PATTERN-KEY: [snake_case]  # optional, for recurrence
SKILL-CANDIDATE: [screener_ops|codegraph|none]
```

## Core Rules

### Rule 1 - Learning
Log explicit corrections and self-identified improvements. Never infer from silence. Confirm patterns after 3 identical lessons.

### Rule 2 - Tiered Storage
- **HOT**: Critical patterns, active preferences (Town: global memories; Hermes: memory.md)
- **WARM**: Per-routine or per-project (Town: routine-scoped memories; Hermes: projects/*.md)
- **COLD**: Archived, decayed (Town: deleted with note; Hermes: archive/)

### Rule 3 - Promotion / Demotion
- 3x in 7 days -> promote to HOT (memory.md or Town global)
- Unused 30 days -> demote to WARM
- Unused 90 days -> archive or delete (ask first)

### Rule 4 - Namespace Isolation
- Town: Use `routine_slug` parameter for routine-specific memories; omit for global
- Hermes: Projects in `projects/{name}.md`, global in `memory.md`, domains in `domains/{name}.md`

### Rule 5 - Conflict Resolution
Most specific wins: routine-specific > domain > global. Most recent wins at same level. **SOUL.md / runtime cron beat stale skill text** — refresh skills when execution truth diverges.

### Rule 6 - Compaction
Merge similar corrections. Archive unused patterns. Never delete without asking. Prefer **short SKILL.md + REFERENCE.md** over bloated skills (see `openclaw-agent-optimize`).

### Rule 7 - Transparency
When applying a learned pattern, mention it briefly. Offer periodic digests. Full export on demand.

### Rule 8 - Security
Never store credentials, health data, or third-party confidential information in memories.

### Rule 9 - Graceful Degradation
Town: Global memories load first. Routine-specific memories load per-session.
Hermes: Load `memory.md` first. Load namespaces on demand.

### Rule 10 - Skill recursion governance
Architecture freeze: skill updates are **Tier 0 docs/plumbing** unless they encode scoring or selector behavior. When in doubt, log to LEARNINGS as `pending` and stop.

## Town-Specific Actions

### Logging a correction
```
add_memory(content="When drafting emails for Darren, never use exclamation points in professional contexts - only in genuinely appreciative notes.")
```

### Logging a routine-specific learning
```
add_memory(routine_slug="town-morning-briefing", content="Include biotech catalyst calendar items in the morning briefing even when no price movement has occurred.")
```

### Reviewing current learnings
```
get_memories()  # global
get_memories(routine_slug="town-morning-briefing")  # routine-specific
```

### Archiving a stale memory
```
delete_memory(memory_id="...")  # after confirming it's no longer relevant
```

## Scope

**ONLY**: Learns from corrections and self-reflection; stores preferences via Town memories or Hermes files; reads memory state; proposes and implements **docs/skills** recursion when eligible.

**NEVER**: Accesses calendar/email/contacts for learning purposes; makes network requests for learning; infers preferences from silence; deletes memories without asking; changes production scoring from learnings alone.
