# Institutional Signal Skill

## Purpose

Reference for the 13F institutional signal pipeline - from SEC EDGAR filing ingestion through coinvest\_score\_z production signal and cohort quarantine governance. This is the dominant selector signal (100% weight in v1.14.0).

This skill is organized into two sections:

1. **Framework Reference** - Stable architecture, rules, and processes (changes only with code updates)
2. **Operational State** - Volatile status snapshots that require periodic refresh

---

## Codegraph Preflight (mandatory before any code edit)

The institutional signal (13F / coinvest_score_z) is the sole selector signal at v1.14.0 — Tier 3. Before editing any symbol, run the standard preflight per `skills/codegraph/SKILL.md`:

1. `codegraph_search("<symbol>")` — locate the target
2. `codegraph_node("<symbol>", source=True)` — inspect signature and body
3. `codegraph_callers("<symbol>")` — identify all production callers
4. `codegraph_callees("<symbol>")` — map downstream dependencies
5. `codegraph_impact("<symbol>", depth=2)` — confirm blast radius

**Gate:** If impact reaches `selector_engine`, `ranker_engine`, `decision_engine`, `final_score`, `coinvest_score_z`, or `rankings.csv` — change is **BLOCKED** until operator approval.

# SECTION 1: FRAMEWORK REFERENCE

---

## Architecture Overview

```
SEC EDGAR 13F-HR filings
  -> warm_13f_cache.py (per-CIK PIT cache dirs)
  -> build_institutional_summary.py (canonical summary)
  -> coinvest_score_z (selector signal, 100% weight v1.14.0)
  -> inst_delta_z (diagnostic/export only in v1.14.0)
```

## Manager Registry

**File**: `production_data/manager_registry.json`
**Never edit directly** - use `tools/onboard_manager.py`

### Tiers

| Tier | Description | Signal Weight |
| --- | --- | --- |
| elite\_core | Highest-conviction biotech-focused managers | Full weight |
| conditional | Broader institutional managers with biotech exposure | Reduced weight |

### Onboarding Flow

```bash
python tools/onboard_manager.py \
  --cik 1802528 \
  --name "Fairmount Funds Management" \
  --aum-b 1.3 \
  --style concentrated_clinical_stage \
  --tier elite_core \
  --notes "..."
```

One-shot flow: registry append -> backfill across every existing PIT dir (lookback=40, approx 10y) -> warm current as-of date -> run `tools/test_manager_integration.py` (6/6 gate).

Partial reruns: `--skip-registry`, `--skip-backfill`, `--skip-current`, `--skip-test`.

---

## coinvest\_score\_z

The production selector signal. Measures institutional co-investment conviction across elite biotech managers.

### Key Properties

- Drives 100% of selector weight (v1.14.0, coinvest-only after inst\_delta\_z demotion)
- Correlation with final\_score: rho = +0.882 (double-count concern, documented in T1 ranker anatomy)
- Checklist v2: 3/5 standalone; prior bundle with inst\_delta is historical evidence only
- Collapse guard: SD floor = 0.10 (below this, snapshot integrity check FAILs)

### Data Flow

1. PIT cache: `data/caches/sec_13f/PIT/{YYYY-MM-DD}/` per manager
2. Canonical summary: `production_data/institutional_summary.json`
3. Delta computation: `institutional_summary_delta.json` (pre vs post refresh)
4. Score: z-scored across eligible universe per snapshot

---

## inst\_delta\_z

Quarter-over-quarter change in institutional holdings. Measures whether smart money is accumulating or distributing.

### Governance Rules

- Reinstatement requires IC recovery evidence documented in governance log
- Current production status: selector weight 0%, absent from the production 2-feature ranker
- Historical audit showed positive within-cohort discrimination (NW-t = +3.32), but this is not active production behavior
- When zeroed, selector runs on coinvest\_score\_z alone and ranker uses only `coinvest_score_z` + `financial_score`

---

## insider\_net\_buy\_value\_90d (Spec 104, Diagnostic Only)

Form 4-derived insider buying signal. Tracks net insider purchase value over a trailing 90-day window.

### Status: DIAGNOSTIC ONLY

- Listed in `DIAGNOSTIC_FIELDS`, NOT in `ALPHA_FEATURE_REGISTRY`
- Tracked and exported for observability
- Does NOT enter the scoring model, ranker, or selector
- Does NOT affect ranks, actions, or position sizing

### Blank vs. Zero Semantics (CRITICAL)

| Value | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| NaN / None / blank | Not fetched, no Form 4 coverage for this ticker |
| 0.0 | Fetched successfully, no insider buy activity in 90-day window |

Never collapse blank and zero. Never impute zero for missing or blank for zero.

### Expectation Model Isolation Guard (Spec 104, R4a)

The expectation model has an `insider_net_buy_z` weight that activates silently if `insider_net_buy_value_90d` flows into `market_features`. This is the fragile path that "diagnostic-only" depends on. Spec 104 requires an explicit guard: either runtime assertion that the field is NOT in `market_features`, or weight zeroing, or a pre-inference drop guard.

### Promotion Criteria (future, not current build)

Requires ALL of: 20+ stable snapshots with >= 60% non-null coverage, blank/zero integrity verified, IC > 0 at p < 0.05, Checklist v2 battery pass, explicit written approval. Until all five are met, insider stays diagnostic.

### Relationship to Crowd-Belief Estimation

If insider data eventually proves useful for crowd-belief estimation (market expectation modeling), it would enter through the expectation pipeline, NOT through the institutional signal pipeline. The 13F-based signals (coinvest\_score\_z, inst\_delta\_z) measure institutional conviction from quarterly portfolio disclosures. Insider buying measures company-insider conviction from Form 4 filings. They are different data sources with different provenance rules.

---

## 13F Refresh Cycle

SEC 13F filings have a 45-day lag from quarter-end. Filings typically cluster in the final 3 business days before the deadline.

### Pre-Refresh Readiness (`tools/prep_13f_refresh.py`)

5 guards, all must PASS:

| Guard | Check |
| --- | --- |
| 1 | Most recent snapshot has valid institutional\_summary\_delta.json |
| 2 | coinvest\_score\_z has healthy variance (SD > 0.10) |
| 3 | PIT cache has entries within 3 days of today |
| 4 | SEC EDGAR endpoint is reachable |
| 5 | Dry-run: build\_institutional\_summary() produces valid output (>=80% coverage) |

Writes baseline artifact: `artifacts/13f_pre_refresh_baseline_{date}.json`

### Cohort Quarantine (`tools/check_13f_cohort_quarantine.py`)

Run after new filings land. Compares pre-refresh vs post-refresh snapshots.

**Sections:**

- A: Manager-level diff (filing counts, coverage)
- B: Coverage diff (tickers\_with\_signal, signal\_coverage\_pct)
- C: Per-ticker score diff (coinvest\_score\_z, inst\_delta\_z distributions)
- D: Top-30 churn (Jaccard similarity, entries/exits, rank movement)

**Verdicts:**

| Verdict | Meaning | Action |
| --- | --- | --- |
| CLEAN | Normal refresh, minimal churn | Proceed |
| QUARANTINE | Significant score/rank disruption | Hold for review |
| PRODUCER\_AUDIT\_REQUIRED | Anomalous coverage or manager changes | Deep investigation |

Telegram alerting on QUARANTINE/PRODUCER\_AUDIT\_REQUIRED (suppressible with `--no-alert`).

### Contamination Window

After adding new managers, a contamination window opens (typically 20 trading days). IC measurements during this window are flagged as contaminated and excluded from clean IC calculations.

---

## Data Provenance Rules

- **Holdings truth source**: `production_data/institutional_summary.json` is canonical
- **CUSIP-first, not issuer-first**: Always reason from CUSIP -> canonical ticker
- **Raw EDGAR XML is debug-only**: Never build narratives from raw filing parses
- **If raw count != summary count**: investigate the summary pipeline first

## Q1 2026 13F-HR Filing Summary (COMPLETE)

*Filed: 2026-05-15*

**Fairmount Funds** (accession 0001104659-26-062419):

- AUM \~$1.38B. Key new: DAMORA THERAPEUTICS ($225.7M, 16.3% of portfolio -- largest new position, NOT signaled by 13D/13G pre-filing). Massive APGE trim (-85.4%), COGT trim (-38.9%). Exits: KINIKSA, NUVALENT. VRDN held (3.9M shares at 3/31). Post-Q1: VRDN stake raised to 14.04% via $20M purchase May 11 (13D/A filed May 13). ORKA 19.99% held.

**Deep Track Capital** (accession 0001856083-26-000003):

- AUM $6,124M (was $5,609M, +9.2%). 63 positions (was 55). SPDR ETF hedge $1,277M. Top equity: GH $308M, IMVT $286M, TARS $252M, VCYT $250M, GPCR $206M. 16 new positions including ALMS ($149M), NUVL ($141M), GMAB ($98M), DFNT ($57M). Biggest adds: JANX +1225%, OCUL +144%, COGT +121%. Exits: DVAX ($242M largest), MNMD, XENE, BHVN, RAPT.

**Logos Global** (accession 0001172661-26-002196):

- AUM $2,003M (was $1,655M, +21.0%). 66 positions. Top: RVMD $194.5M, ERSA $180.4M, IDYA $115M, TERN $105.4M. Massive CNTA add (+963%, now $84.4M top-6 holding). New: UTHR ($47M), MDGL ($44.5M), XENE ($26M). 15 exits including CDTX ($68.5M).

**Coinvest signals**: VRDN (FM 3.9M shares + DT 1.4M shares at 3/31; DT accumulated to 5.4M post-Q1). ORKA (FM 3.7M + DT 2.0M). Triple overlap on CRESCENT BIOPHARMA only. DT+Logos 22 overlaps; top by combined value: IMVT $313M, VCYT $267M, GPCR $230M, CNTA $210M (new -- Logos +963%).

## Q1 2026 Early Signals (13G/13D, pre-13F-HR) -- VALIDATED

*Captured: 2026-05-11. Validated against 13F-HR filings 2026-05-15.*

**Fairmount**: 13D/13G signals mostly validated. COGT trim confirmed ($243M sale 3/31). ORKA 19.99% confirmed. VRDN accumulation confirmed (3.9M shares at 3/31). SURPRISE: DAMORA THERAPEUTICS ($225.7M, 16.3% of portfolio) was NOT signaled by any pre-filing 13D/13G -- largest new position was invisible until 13F-HR dropped.

**Deep Track**: VRDN accumulation was primarily post-Q1 (only 1.4M shares at 3/31 vs 5.4M by May per 13G). ALMS confirmed ($149M new). New positions not signaled by 13G: NUVL ($141M), GMAB ($98M), DFNT ($57M).

**Logos**: TENX and AVLO confirmed. CNTA massive add (+963%) was NOT signaled pre-filing.

**Lesson**: 13D/13G pre-signals capture ~60-70% of major moves but systematically miss sub-5% positions and non-reporting-threshold changes. The largest surprises (DAMORA for Fairmount, CNTA for Logos) were invisible until 13F-HR.
