# Screener Ops & Governance Skill

## Purpose

Reference for daily production operations, the Hermes knowledge layer, agent fleet monitoring, and the spec/governance lifecycle that governs all changes to the biotech screener.

This skill is organized into two sections:

1. **Framework Reference** — Stable pipeline architecture, processes, and governance
2. **Operational State** — Volatile infrastructure status snapshots

---

# SECTION 1: FRAMEWORK REFERENCE

---

## Daily Production Pipeline

**Runner**: `tools/run_daily_production.py` (13-step orchestrator)
**Cron**: 5:30 PM ET weekdays + `@reboot` catch-up for missed runs
**Timeout**: 6000s (100 min) — covers worst-case AACT + tail steps

### Pipeline Steps (in order)

1. Price refresh
2. Cache warm (including FDA)
3. Screen (with `--inputs-manifest write`)
4. Audit
5. Gates
6. Manifest + promotion
7. Drift report
8. Action packet
9. Shadow portfolio
10. Trade plan
11. Portfolio report
12. Readiness scorecard
13. Ops digest + PIT backfill (optional)

**Key Rule**: Always warm 8-K cache BEFORE running screen.

## Hermes Knowledge Layer (Spec 089)

**Generator**: `tools/build_hermes_knowledge_layer.py`

Repo-native "ops brain" that continuously answers:

1. What is the current operational state?
2. What changed since the last good state?
3. What is held, blocked, or awaiting first-fire validation?
4. What contradictions exist across specs, audit memos, cron, and registry?
5. What is the next allowed operator action?
6. What is explicitly not allowed?

### Four Layers

| Layer | Purpose | Output |
|-------|---------|--------|
| Capture | Read-only from specs, artifacts, registry, git, cron | Raw state |
| Normalize | Structured ledgers | `artifacts/ops/knowledge_layer/` |
| Reason | Drift, contradiction, missed-run detection | Alerts |
| Deliver | Operator briefs | Daily/weekly summaries |

### Output Artifacts

| Artifact | Location |
|---------|----------|
| Latest state | `artifacts/ops/knowledge_layer/latest_state.{json,md}` |
| Held spec ledger | `artifacts/ops/held_spec_ledger/latest.{json,md}` |
| First fire ledger | `artifacts/ops/first_fire_ledger/latest.{json,md}` |
| Contradiction ledger | `artifacts/ops/contradiction_ledger/latest.md` |
| Operator briefs | `artifacts/ops/operator_brief/daily/YYYY-MM-DD.md` |

## Town-Hermes Bridge (Spec 090)

**Module**: `common/operator_delivery.py`  
**Full Integration Guide**: See **`town-operator-bridge.md`** skill (includes Phase B call sites, API reference, integration patterns, verification)

Routes Hermes Knowledge Layer events to Town via email trigger. Town does NOT control Hermes.

### Architecture

```
Hermes job completes
  -> write ledger artifact (repo)
  -> send_operator_event(channel="town", ...)
    -> structured email to TOWN_EMAIL (djschulz@gmail.com)
    -> Town routine triggers on [Hermes] subject prefix
    -> Town creates task / DMs operator
```

### Event Types

INFO: `held_spec_ledger`, `first_fire_pass`  
FAIL: `first_fire_fail`, `snapshot_missing`, `ruleset_mismatch`, `cron_missed`  
WARN: `stale_artifact`, `contradiction_detected`

### What Town is NOT

- NOT a scheduler or cron controller
- NOT a repo mutator or spec approver
- NOT allowed to reactivate bioshort_watch LLM
- NOT the authoritative source for any production state

### Phase B Implementation Status (2026-05-27)

**Live call sites:**
- `hermes-held-spec-ledger` — routes held_spec_ledger events (INFO severity, 60m dedupe window)
- `snapshot_complete` — custom event type, routes snapshot promotion results (WARN severity)
- `contradiction_detected` — routes hard/possible contradictions from knowledge layer (WARN severity)

**TODO (Phase B planned extensions):**
- `hermes-first-fire-validator` — route first_fire_pass/fail events (INFO/FAIL severity)
- `agent_supervisor_sentinel` — route snapshot_missing event on watchdog timeout (FAIL severity)
- `hermes-ruleset-integrity` — validate CLAUDE.md vs code, route ruleset_mismatch (FAIL severity)

**Dedupe windows:**
- FAIL: 15 minutes
- WARN: 30 minutes  
- INFO: 60 minutes

**Dry-run status:** `OPERATOR_DELIVERY_DRY_RUN=1` (default, logs only); set to `0` for live email delivery (requires operator approval).

## OpenClaw Agent Fleet

### Agent Registry

**File**: `agents/AGENT_REGISTRY.json`

### Model Configuration

- **Primary**: `deepseek/deepseek-v4-flash:free` (OpenRouter) — fleet-wide migration 2026-05-20; 27 agents migrated
- **Fallback**: Anthropic Claude SDK (for Claude-specific models)
- **Auto-routing**: "deepseek" models → OpenRouter (OpenAI-compatible), "claude" → Anthropic SDK

### Inference Tuning

| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Temperature | 0.2 |
| Frequency penalty | 0.1 |
| Top_p | 0.95 |
| Repetition penalty | 1.2 |
| API timeout | 2400s |
| Retry strategy | Exponential backoff (500ms–8000ms) |

### Uncertainty Handling (all agents)

- ops_supervisor: missing artifacts → RED (not GUESS); confidence < 0.7 → escalate
- sentinel: missing drift → FAIL; boundary cases → WARN
- data_auditor: missing snapshot → FAIL; specific ticker counts (not "some")
- ic_health_monitor: missing dashboard → UNKNOWN; threshold boundaries → ALERT (conservative)
- fleet_steward: unreachable status → MEDIUM; missing last_run → anomalous

### Monitoring Layers

| Layer | Tool | Purpose |
|-------|------|---------|
| Heartbeat | `tools/agent_heartbeat_checks.py` | Per-agent health |
| Supervisor | `agents/ops_supervisor/supervisor.py` | Fleet-wide anomaly classification |
| Post-snapshot | `tools/run_post_snapshot_supervisor.py` | Post-pipeline task orchestration |
| Sentinel | `tools/agent_supervisor_sentinel.py` | Final watchdog |

### Anomaly Classification

| Classification | Severity | Meaning |
|---------------|----------|---------|
| new | ORANGE | First occurrence |
| carried | YELLOW | Same anomaly seen yesterday (exact text match) |
| resolved | GREEN | Previously seen, now gone |

Terminal agents (e.g., ops_supervisor) are intentionally unsupervised — no HEARTBEAT.md.

### Herald Pipeline

Done predicate requires BOTH:
- `data/press_releases/deduped/deduped_{date}.jsonl`
- `data/press_releases/classified/classified_{date}.jsonl`

If classification failed but dedupe exists, next supervisor run retries classification.

---

## SOUL.md / Ruleset System

**SOUL.md**: Per-agent operating manual defining boundaries, tools, and heartbeat checks. Located in `agents/{name}/SOUL.md`.

**Ruleset Health Monitor** (`tools/ruleset_health_monitor.py`): JSONL history grows with each evaluation date. Tracks consecutive WARN days by active ruleset ID. Recommends rollback after sustained degradation.

---

## Spec Lifecycle

### Spec States

| State | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| DRAFT | Under development |
| IN PROGRESS | Active work, phased |
| HELD | Blocked on dependency |
| RESOLVED | All acceptance criteria met |
| SUPERSEDED / MITIGATED | Failure modes neutralized via different route |
| CLOSED | Formally closed |

Each spec has: acceptance criteria with section references, phase gates (A/B/C/D), blocking dependencies, closure memos in `artifacts/audit/`.

### Held-Spec Ledger

Tracks all specs that are held/blocked with: what is held and why, first-fire validation status, alert deadlines, next operator action.

---

## Export Contract Registry (Spec 101)

Status: CLOSED (commits eaa4ea87 + cba4ee0f). `ev_severity_score` now exported.

**Runway severity fields exported (post-Spec 101):**
`runway_severity_score`, `ev_severity_score`, `runway_buffer_months`, `financing_truth_gate`, `dilution_haircut`, `size_multiplier`, `severity_bucket`, `severity_notes`

`check_severity_formulas()` QA validation runs on every snapshot.

---

## Backfill Tooling (Spec 102)

Research-enablement tooling for backfilling expectation fields into historical snapshots.

Target fields: `short_interest_pct`, `close_price`, `market_cap_mm`, `priced_move_pct` (required); `insider_net_buy_value_90d` (optional)

Key rules:
- Default: additive-only (`recompute=False`). Original ranks/actions preserved.
- Every backfill emits a structured manifest
- `_backfill_version` metadata column added to all backfilled snapshots (null for originals)
- Research scripts must filter on `_backfill_version` to avoid silent pre/post mixing

### Cursor Cloud / CI / Hermes Notes

- Cursor Cloud agents need Python deps from `requirements.txt` plus `pytest-xdist` before running `run_screen.py` or pytest on main.
- GitHub Actions failures that say `The job was not started because an Actions budget is preventing further use.` are provider budget/quota blocks, not PR code failures.
- PR #304 is Track B draft/spec-test-only. Expected red fail-closed tests must not be made green without explicit governance clearance.
- Repo-native Hermes MCP can work in Cursor Cloud while production Hermes/Hermes Link runtime is absent; stale cloud knowledge artifacts require local/production refresh before triage.
