# External Intelligence & Context

---

## OpenClaw Status: Maintenance-Only (confirmed May 18, 2026)

- OpenClaw has transitioned to maintenance-only status as of mid-May 2026. Multiple independent sources confirm the project is no longer under active feature development.
- Hermes Agent v0.14.0 (May 16) includes native `hermes claw migrate` tool for seamless migration of configs, API keys, skills, and memory from OpenClaw to Hermes.
- The DEM's 27-agent fleet runs on OpenClaw. Maintenance-only status does not affect current operations — the runtime is stable and functional. But it creates a planning horizon: OpenClaw will not receive new features, and the security patch cadence may slow.
- **Immediate action: none.** The fleet runs on deterministic scripts (Lane A) and `run_agent_direct.py` (Lane B), not on OpenClaw gateway features. A runtime migration is a Tier 4 governance decision, not an urgent operational change.
- **Planning horizon:** Evaluate Hermes as a potential successor runtime in Q4 2026 if OpenClaw patch cadence degrades. Any migration must preserve the AGENT_ROUTING_POLICY.md tier structure and CCFT controls. Self-evolving Hermes skills remain governance-incompatible unless fully versioned and reviewed.

## OpenClaw Security Posture (unchanged)

- Texas A&M SUCCESS Lab (arXiv:2603.27517, April 2026): 470 advisories organized by 7 architectural layers and 5 attack types
- Three Moderate/High-severity advisories compose into complete unauthenticated RCE from LLM tool call to host process
- Exec allowlist bypass via line continuation, busybox multiplexing, GNU long-option abbreviation
- Malicious skill executed two-stage dropper within LLM context, bypassing exec pipeline entirely
- DEM insulation: no agent has authority to modify production weights without traversing the full multi-gate promotion path

## Hermes Agent (Competitive Frame)

- Nous Research, launched February 2026, MIT license, $70M funded ($1B valuation)
- 153K GitHub stars (May 16, 2026 — single dated data point from GitHub)
- v0.14.0 shipped May 16, 2026: xAI Grok integration (1M context via SuperGrok OAuth), OpenAI-compatible local proxy for OAuth providers, Claude operator worker launcher (`hermes claude-operator` for spawning Claude Code tmux workers), 12 P0 + 50 P1 bug closures
- Core differentiator: self-learning Skill Documents (Markdown files created after 5+ tool calls, 40% efficiency gains)
- Self-evolving skill loop is governance-incompatible with CCFT unless every skill mutation is versioned, reviewed, and approved
- Native `hermes claw migrate` tool confirms Nous is actively targeting OpenClaw's installed base
- Recommendation: Monitor as potential successor runtime (Q4 2026 evaluation if OpenClaw patch cadence degrades). Do not adopt now. Any migration must preserve AGENT_ROUTING_POLICY.md tier structure and CCFT controls.

## ODIN Engine (External Benchmark for Clinical Scoring)

- L2-regularized logistic regression, 51 engineered features, 8 signal categories
- AUC: 0.9363 on 2,210 historical FDA events (2000-2025); verified 96.2% accuracy on 53 outcomes
- ODIN feature categories not in DEM: manufacturing/CMC risk, FDA era effects, options market implied probability, sponsor historical approval rate by therapeutic area
- These are Tier 4 evaluation candidates through T5 promotion path

---

## BiotechEdge (External Benchmark for Institutional Signals)

- Tracks 20 specialist biotech hedge funds, $46.5B+ total assets, 1,558+ companies, 2,318+ catalysts
- Fund convergence signal (3+ independent funds buying same stock) validates DEM's coinvest_score_z methodology
- Open-source alternative: pr124/Biotech_Fund_Tracker (GitHub) parsing 38-40 specialist funds

---

## FDA Real-Time Clinical Trial Initiative (April 2026)

- Two RTCT proof-of-concept studies launched: AstraZeneca TRAVERSE (MCL), Amgen STREAM-SCLC
- AI-Enabled Early-Phase Trial Pilot Program RFI (comments due May 29, 2026; selections August 2026)
- Projected 20-40% trial duration reduction, $120M annual savings
- If trials become continuous rather than phase-gated, binary catalyst model evolves — affects catalyst_decay_w and catalyst_quality calibration. Monitor as Tier 4 governance question.

---

## AI Drug Pipeline (Q1 2026)

- 173+ AI-originated programs in clinical trials (94 Phase I, 56 Phase II, 15 Phase III) — 7x increase since 2022
- Pre-clinical compression: 4-6 years to 12-24 months. Clinical timelines unchanged.
- Insilico Medicine Rentosertib: first fully AI-designed drug with Phase IIa results (Nature Medicine, June 2025)
- Isomorphic Labs: $2.1B Series B (May 2026). Recursion: fifth Sanofi milestone ($134M cumulative)
- 2026 is definitive validation year — Phase III results determine if AI improves beyond ~90% historical failure rate

---

## Industry AI Adoption

- 92% of hedge funds with $1B+ AUM use AI/ML (up from 56% in 2022); 67% describe as "integral"
- AI-integrated funds outperform traditional systematic strategies by 3-4pp annually
- NBIM ($2.1T): ~50% of 680 staff code own AI tools using Claude; all employees use AI daily
- Only 21% of organizations deploying AI have formal governance frameworks — DEM's merged governance artifacts place it in the leading minority
