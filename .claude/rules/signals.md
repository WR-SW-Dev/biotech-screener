# Signals, Specs & Feature Status

## Signal Naming (Current)
| Current Name | Legacy Name | Notes |
|-------------|-------------|-------|
| `coinvest_score_z` | `sponsorship_score_z` | Renamed v1.14.0 |
| `inst_delta_z` | `momentum_delta_z` | Renamed v1.14.0 |

Always use current names in new code. Legacy names may appear in older docs — treat as identical.

## Insider Diagnostic (Spec 104)
`insider_net_buy_value_90d` is **DIAGNOSTIC ONLY**. Tracked in `DIAGNOSTIC_FIELDS`, explicitly excluded from `ALPHA_FEATURE_REGISTRY`. Does NOT enter scoring model, ranker, or selector.

**CRITICAL**: The expectation model has an `insider_net_buy_z` weight that activates silently if the field flows into `market_features`. Spec 104 R4a requires an explicit isolation guard.

**Blank vs. Zero**: NaN/None/blank = not fetched. 0.0 = fetched, no insider buy activity. Never collapse blank and zero.

**Promotion requires ALL of**: 20+ stable snapshots, >= 60% non-null coverage, IC > 0 at p < 0.05, Checklist v2 pass, explicit written approval.

## Expectation Layer Coverage Gate (Spec 105)
Production hard-fails if market-expectation fields are missing or under-covered in `rankings.csv`.

| Field | Threshold | Blocking |
|-------|-----------|----------|
| `short_interest_pct` | 0.90 | Yes |
| `close_price` | 0.99 | Yes |
| `market_cap_mm` | 0.95 | Yes |
| `priced_move_pct` | 0.80 | Yes |
| `insider_net_buy_value_90d` | 0.30 | No (diagnostic) |

Thresholds sourced from `FEATURE_COVERAGE_REQUIREMENTS` (single source of truth).
