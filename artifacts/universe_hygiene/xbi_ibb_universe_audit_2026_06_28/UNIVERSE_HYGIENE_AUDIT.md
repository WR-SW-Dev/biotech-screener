## Stale / Inactive Model Names

Staleness cutoff: last price before 2026-06-15 (10 trading days before 2026-06-28).

### Delisted / Inactive (7 tickers)

| Ticker | Company | Status | Last Price | Note |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| APLS | Apellis Pharmaceuticals, Inc. | delisted | 2026-05-15 | Already flagged |
| GLPG | Lakefront Biotherapeutics NV | delisted | 2026-06-26 | Already flagged |
| KALV | KalVista Pharmaceuticals Inc | delisted | 2026-06-12 | Already flagged |
| ACLX |  | delisted | 2026-04-29 | Already flagged |
| DAWN |  | delisted | 2026-04-24 | Already flagged |
| FOLD |  | delisted | 2026-04-27 | Already flagged |
| TERN |  | delisted | 2026-05-07 | Already flagged |

### Price Data Notes

- `_XBI_BENCHMARK_` — placeholder entry in universe.json, no price data (expected — it is a benchmark, not a trading ticker)
- `ATXS`, `CVAC`, `MRSN` — price data exists in CSV but these tickers are NOT in universe.json (orphaned price rows, likely historical)
- `IBB` — IBB ETF benchmark price row in price CSV, not a model constituent

**Notes:**
- `RNA` — Ticker was re-assigned. Old `RNA` (Avidity Biosciences) was acquired by Novartis. New `RNA` in model = Atrium Therapeutics (spun off). Status: active, price current. **Monitor: ensure this is the intended entity.**
- `GOSS` — Gossamer Bio; status: active, price current.
- `REPL` — Replimune Group; status: active, price current.
- `ACLX`, `DAWN`, `FOLD`, `TERN` — all status=delisted with None company name. Confirm delisting and purge data.
- `APLS` — Apellis Pharmaceuticals; status=delisted; last price 2026-05-15.
- `GLPG` — Lakefront Biotherapeutics NV; status=delisted.
- `KALV` — KalVista Pharmaceuticals; status=delisted; last price 2026-06-12.

## Recommended Universe Actions

### 1. Confirm and clean delisted tickers (7 tickers)
All 7 delisted tickers (`APLS`, `GLPG`, `KALV`, `ACLX`, `DAWN`, `FOLD`, `TERN`) are already flagged `status=delisted` in universe.json. No immediate action required, but their price history should be frozen and they should be excluded from all model scoring.

### 2. Investigate GOSS price staleness
GOSS (Gossamer Bio) shows `status=active` but price data in split-adjusted CSV may be stale — verify current price feed.

### 3. RNA ticker re-assignment watch
The ticker `RNA` now maps to Atrium Therapeutics (new post-spinoff entity). Ensure backtest data before the Novartis acquisition of old RNA (Avidity) is not contaminating model signals for the new entity.

### 4. ETF coverage gap candidates
If ETF data was successfully fetched: evaluate 5 XBI core biotech candidates and 2 IBB core biotech candidates for potential addition in the next universe refresh cycle.

### 5. Orphaned price rows
ATXS, CVAC, MRSN have price history rows but are not in universe.json. These are likely historical tickers that were removed. Consider cleaning the price CSV.

### 6. Corrupt price CSV rows
The price CSVs contain ~39 rows with malformed ticker names (contain 'TICKER\n' pattern). These appear to be DataFrame repr strings accidentally appended. The audit filtered them out — but the underlying data write should be fixed.

## Risks and Caveats

- ETF holdings may be from a stale snapshot if live fetch failed. Use `--fetch-current-etf-holdings` with a valid internet connection.
- XBI and IBB hold different subsets. Coverage gaps vs XBI are more actionable for small-cap pure-play biotech.
- The 10-trading-day stale threshold is a heuristic. Some tickers may have legitimate data gaps due to halts or low volume.
- RNA ticker reuse across two different companies is a known risk; the audit flags it but cannot automatically determine correctness.
- Large-cap biopharma exclusion list (`LARGE_CAP_EXCLUSIONS`) is hardcoded; verify it reflects current policy.

## Next Validation Steps

1. Re-run with fresh XBI/IBB live fetch once network/auth is confirmed.
2. For each `MISSING_CORE_BIOTECH_CANDIDATE`: manual review of market cap, pipeline stage, liquidity before any add proposal.
3. For delisted tickers (ACLX, DAWN, FOLD, TERN — missing company name): source company name and final delisting date for archival.
4. Investigate and fix root cause of malformed price CSV rows (`TICKER\n` pattern).
5. Confirm RNA entity mapping with explicit audit trail.
6. Review KALV delisting date (last price 2026-06-12, very recent).
